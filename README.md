# InetSysDev-GH-Community-Health
GHCommunityHealth is an enhancement project for [GHData](https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata) that
involves implementing new metrics and metric aggregation.  Like GHData, this is a Python project. 
For more information, see our
[System Description file](SystemDescription.md).

This repository is a staging ground for
code that could be added to GHData's codebase.  Code that is being submitted to GHData will be merged
into our [fork](https://github.com/kalepeterson/ghdata) before being included in a pull request to
OSSHealth's GHData.
